# My-Learning-Tracker
A complete log of my web development skills, learning, resources, highlights, interests, and everything to do with my learning. It's a way to keep track, organise, and share my learning.

## Interests

Things that appeal to me at the moment:  

+ Spring Framework;
+ Testing: JUnit, Mockito;
+ Gradle and Maven.

## Acknowledgments
